## **Technological Terms in Relation to Biosensors**

- **EEG (Electroencephalography) **: measures the electrical activity of the brain to detect changes via specific brainwaves that operate on certain frequencies. Used to detect brain & sleep conditions. Device with electrodes placed on head. 

- Alpha: Activity corresponding to a relaxed yet wakeful state (8-12hz)

- Theta: Activity corresponding to light sleep, dreaming, and deep relaxation (4-8hz)

- Beta: Activity corresponding to alertness and being engaged in mental tasks (12-30hz)

- Delta: Activity corresponding to deep sleep (0.5-4hz)

- **ECG/EKG (Electrocardiogram) **: measures the electrical activity of the heart to detect changes. Used to detect heart conditions. Electrodes are placed on the chest, arms, and legs. 

- **EMG (Electromyography)** : measures the electrical activity of the muscles to detect neuromuscular abnormalities. Involves the insertion of a thin-needle electrode into a muscle to record activity during rest and retraction.

- **sEMG (Surface Electromyography/Non-Invasive Electromyography):**

- **PPG (Photoplethysmography) **: uses light to measure blood volume changes to detect how much light is absorbed or reflected by blood vessels in the skin. Used for non-invasive heart-rate tracking, blood oxygen saturation, and other cardiovascular signals. 

- **Raw PPG: **raw, unprocessed signal directly recorded by a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. Unlike cleaned or processed PPG data, the raw signal contains both the desired cardiovascular information (like heart rate) and undesirable noise. This raw data offers granular detail, allowing for more transparent and in-depth analysis and serves as a valuable alternative to the coarser outputs of consumer-grade devices.

- **EDA/GSR (Electrodermal Activity or Galvanic Skin Response)** : measures the electrical properties of your skin by detecting changes in sweat gland activity. Sweat gland activity being linked to emotional arousal and stress levels via the sympathetic nervous system. Uses electrodes, often with a silver-chloride contact point, to measure these subtle changes in skin conductance.

- **TEMP (Thermometric) **: measures the heat produced or absorbed by biological reactions to detect and quantify the presence and concentration of specific biomolecules or substances in a sample. These devices use immobilized biological components, such as enzymes or antibodies, to interact with a target analyte, triggering a thermochemical reaction that is then detected by a temperature sensor, providing a signal proportional to the analyte's presence

- **PRV ( Pulse Rate Variability)**: refers to the change in the interval between pulses in the blood volume pulse (BVP) signal acquired using photoplethysmography (PPG). PRV is an indicator of the health status of an individualâ€™s autonomic nervous system (ANS).

- **HR:** Heart Rate:

- **HRV (Heart Rate Variability) :** refers to the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, measured in milliseconds.

- **IMU ( Inertial Measurement Unit)**: device that combines an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to measure movement and orientation in 3D space. Used in biosensing applications for biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. They attach to the body to track motions like limb movement and gait, providing data used for performance analysis and training. 

- **ACC (Accelerometer) **: an electronic sensor that measures acceleration. It detects motion by measuring the forces acting on a tiny mass suspended by a spring or other method. Used in many common devices, including smartphones for orientation detection and fitness tracking, vehicles for airbag deployment, and industrial equipment for vibration analysis.

- **Gyroscope:** measures and detects rotational movement and changes in orientation by detecting a device's angular velocity, the rate at which it is rotating around an axis. Essential for maintaining stability and orientation in various devices.

- **Magnetometer:** magnetic field sensor used to measure magnetic fields in both strength and direction. In biosensors it is used to detect biological targets by sensing the magnetic fields around them.
